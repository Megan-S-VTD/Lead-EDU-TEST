# Lead EDU

An interactive teaching tool for lead exposure education in schools.

## What is Lead EDU?

Lead Ed is a multi-user experience that allows a whole class of students to understand lead contamination and prevention techniques for lead poisoning. Lead Ed utilizes the video game, Minecraft, and the customization capabilities of the game to create a fun and educational experience. Students will encounter topics such as; nutrition, lead poisoning, sources of lead contamination, and ways to handle and reduce lead exposure levels.

Students play as a child helping their friend be cured of his case of lead poisoning. Throughout their play-through, students must also monitor their own lead contamination levels to prevent themselves from getting lead poisoning as well. 

This experience comes in two formats, based on how long teachers wish to have the lesson. There is a shorter 15 minute experience and a 1 hour long experience.
